# Snake
Snake is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line
itself being the primary obstacle. This is a basic implementation of the game created following an YouTube tutorial,
which can be found at this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dfePlONtls

## Explanation
The player controls a dot, square, or object on a bordered plane. As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind,
resembling a moving snake. In some games, the end of the trail is in a fixed position, so the snake continually gets
longer as it moves. In another common scheme, the snake has a specific length, so there is a moving tail a fixed number
of units away from the head. The player loses when the snake runs into the screen border, other obstacle, or itself.
